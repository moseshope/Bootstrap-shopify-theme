## Demonstration

- **Store Link**: https://maxvien-bootstrap.myshopify.com
- **Store Password**: `maxvien`

## Installation

Clone the source code into your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maxvien/bootstrap-shopify-theme.git
```

Install the project's dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

## Configuration

To config the project, you need to copy and rename the `config.yml.example` file to the `config.yml` file. Then update the `store`, `password`, `theme_id` properties.

There are two sections in the `config.yml` file:

- The `development` section is for your **development** store.
- The `production` section is for your **production** store.

```yml
development:
  store: store-name.myshopify.com
  password: store-admin-api-password
  theme_id: store-theme-id

production:
  store: store-name.myshopify.com
  password: store-admin-api-password
  theme_id: store-theme-id
```

### Store Property

To fill the `store` property, you copy your store's **hostname** and paste it to the `config.yml` file.

### Password Property

To fill the `password` property, please follow these steps:

1. From your Shopify admin, click **Apps**.
2. Near the bottom of the page, click **Manage private apps**.
3. If private app development is disabled, then click **Enable private app development**. Only the store owner can [enable private app development](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/private-apps?#enable-private-app-development-from-the-shopify-admin).
4. Click **Create new private app**.
5. In the **App details** section, fill out the app name and your email address.
6. In the **Admin API** section, click **Show inactive Admin API permissions**.
7. Scroll to the **Themes** section and select **Read and write** from the dropdown.
8. Click **Save**.
9. Read the private app confirmation dialog, then click **Create app**.
10. In the **Admin API** section of the **App**, copy the **password** and paste it into the `config.yml` file.

### Theme ID Property

To fill the `theme_id` property, please follow these steps:

1. From your Shopify admin, click **Online Store**.
2. At the top of the **Online Store** menu, click **Themes**.
3. In the **Current theme** section, click **Actions** and select **Duplicate** to backup your current theme.
4. Next, click the **Customize** button.
5. There is a link like this `https://store-name.myshopify.com/admin/themes/[theme_id]/editor` on your browser's address bar. Copy the **theme_id** and paste it into the `config.yml` file.

## Development

To develop the theme, you need to follow the [**Configuration**](#configuration) to config the `development` section in the `config.yml` file.

Next, run this commmand to run the **development** server.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open https://localhost:8080/ with your browser to see the result.
