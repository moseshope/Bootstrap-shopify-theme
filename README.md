## Notes

### Assets

All files inside the `theme/assets` directory are ignored by `git`, except files starting with the `static` keyword in their filename.

### Webpack Encore

[Symfony Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html) is a simpler way to integrate Webpack into your application. It wraps Webpack, giving you a clean & powerful API for bundling JavaScript modules, pre-processing CSS & JS and compiling and minifying assets. Encore gives you professional asset system that‚Äôs a delight to use.

If you want to use [React](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html) or [Vue](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/vuejs.html) in the theme, you can follow the documentation [here](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html).
